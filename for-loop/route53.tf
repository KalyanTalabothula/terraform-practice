# before creating route53, we need some ec2 Private IP address. 
# So, we need output of "aws_instance" "roboshop" so that we will create it.

# For that we have syntax of output like variable syntax only. like piping 

# ðŸ”Ž aws route 53 terraform,  syntax will be there for route 53

# line 12 : dot . is static that is not variable -->interpolation, we need mongodb.kalyanu.xyz right
